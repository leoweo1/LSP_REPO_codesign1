ME: I need to analyze the StudentPortalHelper class using Arthur Riel heuristics to determine if it has high or low cohesion. Then I need to explain whether a well-designed class should have high or low cohesion, and if changes are needed, describe how to refactor the class.
AI: Based on Arthur Riel's heuristics, the StudentPortalHelper class demonstrates very low cohesion. It violates heuristic H.4 ("A class should capture one and only one key abstraction") and H.5 ("All operations should be functionally related to the class name")...
ME: Can you explain what high cohesion means and why it's important?
AI: High cohesion means that all elements of a class are focused on a single, well-defined purpose. It's important because it makes code easier to understand, maintain, test, and reuse. Highly cohesive classes have clear responsibilities...
ME: How would you refactor this class to improve cohesion?
AI: I would break it down into several focused classes: AcademicCalculator for GPA computation, FileExporter for CSV operations, NotificationService for email formatting, SecurityUtils for password checking, PaymentProcessor for payment handling, and a separate CacheService...
